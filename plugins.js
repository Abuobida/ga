Ga plugins
==========
Weclome to the `plugins.js` file!
This file contains lots of extra tools that are really useful for making games, 
but which are more specialized that than the universal tools in `ga.js` file. 

How can use these plugins? The easiest way is just to link this entire file 
with a `<script>` tag. Then you have immediate access to all this code 
and you can decide later what you really need. 

Your own custom plugins
-----------------------

If you wan to keep you game file size small, create 
your own custom plugins file. Here's how: 

1. Make a new JS file called `custom.js` (or an other name you want to give it.)
2. Add this:

    GA.custom = function(ga) {
      //Your own collection of plugins will go here
    };

3. Link `custom.js` to your game's main HTML document with a `<script>` tag.

4. Then just copy/paste any plugin functions from this 
file (`plugins.js`) into your own `custom.js` file. Like this:

    GA.custom = function(ga) {
      //Create a random number within a specific range
      ga.random = function(min, max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
      };
    };

The `GA.custom` function is called by Ga as soon as the engine has 
finished initializing, but before the game runs. This means you 
can use it to run any other custom setup task that you want to 
perform before any of the game code runs. You could also use the 
`GA.custom` function to overwrite any of Ga's default properties 
with your own. Go wild!

The plugins in this file
------------------------

The code in this `plugins.js` file is organized into chapters. 
Use your text editor's search features to find what you're looking for. 
Here's the table of contents to get you started:

### Chapter 1: Utilities

`move`: Make a sprite or group move (or an array of them) by updating its velocity.
`distance`: The distance in pixels between the center point of two sprites.
`ease`: Make a sprite ease to the position of another sprite.
`easeProperty`: Ease a single sprite property to another value.
`slide`: Ease a sprite to a specific position.
`fadeIn`: Fade in a sprite.
`fadeOut`: Fade out a sprite.
`follow`: Make a sprite follow another sprite at a fixed speed.
`rotateAround`: Make a sprite rotate around the center of another sprite.
`rotatePoint`: Make any x/y point rotate around any other point.
`angle`: Get the angle between the center points of two sprites
`random`: Generate a random number within a range.
`wait`: Wait for a certain number of milliseconds and then execute a callback function.

### Chapter 2: Sprite creation tools

`shoot`: A function for making sprites shoot bullets.
`grid`: Easily plot a grid of sprites. Returns a container full of sprite `children` .

### Chapter 3: Collision

#### Boundary collisions

`outsideBounds`: Tells you if a sprite has exceeded the boundary of another sprite or container.
`contain`: Contains a sprite inside another sprite. Optional bounce if the sprite hits the edges.

#### Shape collisions

`hitTestPoint`: Returns `true` or `false` if an x/y point is intersecting a rectangle or circle.
`hitTestCircle`: Returns `true` if any two circular sprites overlap.
`hitTestRectangle`: Returns `true` if any two rectangular sprites overlap.
`rectangleCollision`: Prevents two colliding rectangles from overlapping and tells you the collision side
`circleCollision`: Makes a moving circle bounce away from a stationary circle.
`movingCircleCollision`: Makes two moving circles bounce apart.
`multipleCircleCollision`: Bounce apart any two circles that are in the same array.
`bounceOffSurface`: A helper method that's use internally by these collision functions.

#### 2D tile-based collisions

... coming soon!

### Chapter 4: Sprite controllers

`keyControlFourWay`: Assign keyboard keys to make a sprite move at a fixed speed in 4 directions

  ### grid
  Create the grid of pegs using the `grid` function. `grid` returns a

  top left corner of each cell should be. Supply a function that
  returns the sprite that you want to make for each cell. You can
  supply an optional final function that runs any extra code after
  each sprite has been created. Here's the format for creating a grid:

  #### circleCollision

  Use this function to prevent a moving circular sprite from overlapping and optionally
  bouncing off a non-moving circular sprite.
  Parameters: 
  a. A sprite object with `x`, `y` `centerX`, `centerY` and `radius` properties.
  b. A sprite object with `x`, `y` `centerX`, `centerY` and `radius` properties.
  c. Optional: `true` or `false` to indicate whether or not the first sprite
  d. Optional: `true` or `false` to indicate whether or not local or global sprite positions should be used. 
  This defaults to `true` so set it to `false` if you want to use the sprite's local coordinates.
  should bounce off the second sprite.
  The sprites can contain an optional mass property that should be greater than 1.
