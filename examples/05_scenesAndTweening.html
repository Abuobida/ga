  Create a `group` called `sceneOne` and add the
  `blackSquare` and `messageOne` to it.
  Groups are empty containers for sprites. You can think of them
  as a special kind of sprite that doesn't display its own image. a
  group's job is 
  just to display the sprites that are inside it. Groups have the
  all same properties as ordinary sprites, so any changes that you
  make the parent, such as its size, position or visibility, will
  affect the child sprites that it contains. The `width` and
  `height` of the group is determined by the size and position of
  the sprites inside it. Whenever you use `addChild` or `remChild` to 
  add or remove a sprite from a group, the group's `width` and `height`
  is recalculated based on what it contains
