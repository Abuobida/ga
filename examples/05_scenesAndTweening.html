  Create a `group` called `sceneOne` and add the
  `blackSquare` and `messageOne` to it.
  Groups are empty containers for sprites. You can think of them
  as a special kind of sprite that doesn't display its own image. a
  group's job is 
  just to display the sprites that are inside it. Groups have the
  all same properties as ordinary sprites, so any changes that you
  make the parent, such as its size, position or visibility, will
  affect the child sprites that it contains. The `width` and
  `height` of the group is determined by the size and position of
  the sprites inside it. Whenever you use `addChild` or `remChild` to 
  add or remove a sprite from a group, the group's `width` and `height`
  is recalculated based on what it contains
  */

  sceneOne = g.group(blackSquare, messageOne);

  //Alternatively, you could first create an empty group and 
  //use `addChild` to add the sprites, like this:
  /*
  sceneOne = g.group();
  sceneOne.addChild(blackSquare);
  sceneOne.addChild(messageOne);
  */

  //Make a blue square and some text.
  blueSquare = g.rectangle(128, 128, "cyan");
  messageTwo = g.text("Two", "16px puzzler", "red");
  messageTwo.setPosition(40, 52);

  //Create a `sceneTwo` group and add `blueSquare` and
  //`messageTwo`
  sceneTwo = g.group(blueSquare, messageTwo);
  sceneTwo.x = 128;
  sceneTwo.y = 128;

  //You can change the depth layers of sprites
  //or groups or sprites using the `layer` property
  //sceneOne.layer = 1;
  //sceneTwo.layer = 2;

  /*
  Ga has four special tween functions to help you manage scene
  or sprite transitions:

      slide
      yoyo
      fadeIn
      fadeOut

  They're special because they don't need to run inside a looping game
  state (like `play`) to work. That makes them easy to launch with callback functions.
  `slide` eases a sprite from its start position to a destination x
  and y point at a certain speed. It returns a tween object. You can
  attach an `onComplete` method to the tween object to do something
  when the tween has finished. It also has a Boolean `playing`
  property that tells you whether or not the tween is playing. Use
  `tween.pause()` and `tween.play()` to pause and play the tweens at
  any time. You can completely remove a tween with
  `ga.removeTween(tweenObject).
  `yoyo` is the same as `slide`, but the tween will bounce back and
  forth between its start and end points, forever. You can give it an
  option `delay` argument that defines how long, in milliseconds, the
  tween should hold its position until it bounces back again.
  `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` work the same way, and change the sprite's
  `alpha` property.
  All of these special tweens are managed in Ga's `tweens` array.
  */

  //Here's an example that uses most of these methods and features

  //Use the `wait` methods to wait 2 seconds before tweening
  //the scenes
  g.wait(2000, function(){
    //`slide` arguments:
    //sprite, destinationX, destinationY, speed
    oneTween = g.slide(sceneOne, 128, 128, 0.05); 
    //`yoyo` arguments:
    //sprite, destinationX, destinationY, speed, delayInMilliseconds
    twoTween = g.yoyo(sceneTwo, 0, 0, 0.05, 2000); 
    //Make `sceneOne` fade out
    //`fadeOut` arguments:
    //sprite, speed
    g.fadeOut(sceneOne, 0.02);

    //Use `oneTween`'s `onComplete` method to do something when the
    //tween is finished. In this example we'll make it slide back to
    //its starting position and fade it back in
    oneTween.onComplete = function(){
      g.slide(sceneOne, oneTween.startX, oneTween.startY, 0.05);
      //`fadeIn` arguemnts:
      //sprite, speed
      g.fadeIn(sceneOne, 0.02);
    };
    /*
    g.wait(4000, function(){
        //Remove a tween completely with the `removeTween` method
        g.removeTween(twoTween);
    });
    */
  });
