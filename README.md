Ga
===

*"Ga!"*
*- A baby's exclamation of surprise.*

Ga is a minimalist game engine for making HTML5 games or any other
kind interactive media. Its design was inspired by the [js13k game
competition](http://js13kgames.com) where contestants are required to make a
game with a total file of size no more than 13k. 

How can you make a game with such a small file size?

It's a useful to use a game engine, because starting any game first
requires writing a lot of tedious boilerplate code. You don't' want to
have to re-write all that stuff for every game you make. But most full-featured HTML5
game engines, even small and fast ones like
[Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser), are still at least 1
Megabyte-ish in size. The goal for Ga was to design a full-featured,
fun-to-use 2D game engine with a
compressed file size of no more than 6.5k. 

6.5k?

Yes, it can be done!

Take a look at the feature list and the `examples` folder to get
started. Keep scrolling and you'll find a complete beginner's
turtorial ahead. If you've never made a game before, the tutorials are
the best place to start.

Features
--------

Here's Ga's full feature list:

- All the most important sprites you need: rectangles, circles, lines,
  text, image sprites and animated "MovieClip" style sprites. You can make any of these
  sprites with one only line of code. You can also create your own custom sprite
  types.
- A complete scene graph with nested child-parent hierarchies (including
  a `stage`, and `addChild`/`removeChild` methods), local and global
  coordinates, depth layers, and rotation pivots.
- `group` sprites together to make game scenes. 
- A game loop with a user-definable `fps` and fully customizable and
  drop-dead-simple game state manager. `pause` and `resume` the game
  loop at any time.
- Tileset (spritesheet) support using `frame` and `filmstrip` methods to make
  sprites using tileset frames.
- Built-in texture atlas support for the popular Texture Packer format.
- A keyframe animation and state manager for sprites. Use `show` to
  display a sprite's image state. Use `play` or `playSequence` to play
  a sequence of frames (in a `loop` if you want to). Use
  `gotoAndStop` to go to a specific frame number. Use `fps` to set the
  frame rate for sprite animations which is independent from the game's
  frame rate.
- Interactive `button` sprites with `up`, `over` and `down` states.
- Any sprite can be set as `interactive` to receive mouse and touch
  actions.
  Intuitive `press` and `release` methods for buttons and interactive
  sprites.
- Easy-to-use keyboard key bindings. The arrow and space keys are
  built-in, and you can easily define your own with the `keyboard`
  method.
- A built-in universal `pointer` that works with both the mouse and
  touch. Define as many pointers as you need for multi-touch.
- Import and play sounds using a built-in WebAudio API sound manager.
  Control sounds with `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `restart`, and
  `playFrom` methods. Change a sound's `volume` and `pan`.
- Conveniently position sprites relative to other sprites using `put`.
- A universal asset loader to pre-load images, fonts, sounds and JSON
  data files. All popular file formats are supported. You can load new assets into the game at
  any time.
- An optional `load` state that lets you run actions while assets are
  loading. You can use the `load` state to add a loading progress bar.
- A fast and focused canvas-based rendering engine.
- A sophisticated game loop using a fixed timestep with variable rendering
  and sprite interpolation. That means you get ultra-smooth sprite animations
  at any framerate.
- A `plugins.js` file full of extra tools. 
- A compact and powerful "Haiku" style API that's centered on shallow,
  composable components. Get more done writing less code.
- Ga is totally hackable. Overwrite any of its default methods or objects
  with your own at compile or run time.
- Yes, Ga is mobile friendly!
- Yes, the core `ga.js` engine is less than 6.5k minified and zipped!
  It's all you need to start making any any 2D action, puzzle or
  strategy game. 

And the coolest part? If you were alone on a desert island with only
a saltwater powered laptop, an unlimited supply of
coconuts, and a copy of `ga.js` you could recreate the entire history of 2D video games,
from SpaceWar! to Flappy Bird.

### The plugins

But there's more! Ga comes with a `plugins.js` file that includes a
huge number of useful tools for making games. You can use as many or
as few of these tools as you want to. Here are some of the goodies
you'll find in `plugins.js`:

- Make versatile particle explosions with `burst`.
- Shake sprites or the screen with `shake`.
- Tween functions for sprite and scene transitions: `slide`,
  `yoyo`, `fadeIn`, `fadeOut` and `pulse`.
- A handful of useful convenience functions: `ease`, `follow`,
  `angle`, `distance`, `rotateAround`, `rotatePoint`, `wait`,
  `random`, `randomFloat`, `contain` and `outsideBounds`.
- A fast, universal `hit` method that handles collision testing and
  reactions for all types of sprites. Use one collision method for
  everything: rectangles, circles, points, and arrays of sprites.
  Easy!
- A companion suite of lightweight, low-level 2D geometric collision methods.
- A loading progress bar for game assets.
- Make sprites shoot things with `shoot`. 
- Easily plot sprites in a grid formation with `grid`.
- Tiled Editor support using `makeTiledWorld`. Design your game in
  Tiled Editor and access all the sprites, layers and objects directly
  in your game code. It's an extremely fun, quick and easy way to make
  games.
- A versatile, `hitTestTile` method that handles all the collision
  checking you'll need for tile-based games. You can use it in combination
  with the any of the 2D geometric collision methods for optimized
  broadphase/narrowphase collision checking if you want to.
- Use `updateMap` to keep a tile-based world's map data array up-to-date
  with moving sprites.
- Create a `worldCamera` that follows sprites around a scrolling game
  world.

To use the plugins, just copy/paste the code you want to use from `plugins.js` into your game. 
Or, if you're not worried about the extra size, 
just link the whole thing; it's really tiny anyway!

If you want to get fancy, you can alternatively create your own `custom.js` file that 
contains a small custom sub-set of the plugins
you want to use for your game. Your `custom.js` file can load at
compile time, so it's ready to use before your game code runs. 
(See the `plugins.js` file for instructions on how to do this).

### Coming very soon... 

- Tiled Editor isometric maps support.
- Many more examples including complete game prototypes.
- Additional documentation, examples, and tutorials.

Ga's philosophy and technical constraints
-----------------------------------------

- The `ga.js` core game engine file can't ever be bigger that 6.5k
  minified and zipped. This makes it suitable for making games for micro game
  competitions, like [js13k](http://js13kgames.com). But, more
  importantly, this constraint also discourages feature-creep and keeps
  the engine lean and focused.
- The API has to be fun, intuitive and expressive with as little
  boilerplate code as possible. Game designers should be 
  free to explore their imaginations without tripping over a tangled
  and messy API. Less typing, Less thinking!
- The source code must be easily readable and comment-rich so that
  everyone can learn from it. It should also be architecturally flat
  so that anyone can rip it apart and easily drop it into something
  else.
- Any special features, like Tiled Editor support, can be added to the
  plugins.js file, so that game developers can pick and choose a
  minimal custom set of components they want for specific games without bloating the core engine.

Minifying, crushing and compressing
-----------------------------------

The Ga repository doesn't include the minified and compressed version
of the source code, because you should probably optimize that yourself. I recommend
first minifying the code using with [Google Closure
Compiler](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) (Simple mode only) or
[UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2). 

Then, zip it.

For more aggressive optimization, you could further try running the
minified code through
[JSCrush](http://www.iteral.com/jscrush/). Although it sometimes makes
things worse rather than better - you'll have to test it with your
code.

Note: If you're using Google Closure Compiler from the command line, set the `--language_in`
flag to `ECMASCRIPT5`, like this:

`java -jar ~/compiler.jar --language_in=ECMASCRIPT5 --js ga.js --js_output_file ga.min.js`


Contributions and Licencing
---------------------------
It's Ga's ambition to be the world's tiniest, cutest and funnest game engine.
Please help! If you find something that's bad, please help to fix it.
If you find something good, please help to make it better.
Ga welcomes any and all contributions!

Licensing? Ga is vehemently *unlicenesed*.
That means its freer than free.

It's like a pebble.
You can pick it up and throw into the sea.

Tutorials
---------

How do you make a video game? These tutorials will show you how. 

But first, you should have a reasonable understanding of HTML and
JavaScript. You don't have to be an expert, just an ambitious beginner
with an eagerness to learn. If you don't know HTML and JavaScript, the
best place to start learning it is this book:

[Foundation Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript](http://www.apress.com/9781430247166)

I know for a fact that it's the best book, because I wrote it :)

There are also some good internet resources to help get you started:

[Khan Academy: Computer
Programming](http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs)

[Code Academy:
JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

Ok, got it?
Do you know what JavaScript variables, functions, arrays and objects are and how to
use them? Good, then read on!

### Treasure Hunter

The first game we're going to make is a simple object collection and
enemy avoidance game called Treasure Hunter. Open the file
`01_treasureHunter.html` in a web browser. (You'll find it in Ga's
`tutorials` folder, and you'll need to run it in a
[webserver](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server)).

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/01.png)

Use the keyboard to move the explorer (the blue square), collect the
treasure (the yellow square), avoid the monsters (the red squares) and
reach the exit (the green square.) Yes, you have to use your
imagination - for now.

Don't be fooled by it's apparent simplicity. Treasure Hunter contains
everything a video game needs:

- Interactivity
- Collision
- Sprites
- A game loop
- Scenes
- game logic
- "Juice" (in the form of sounds)

(What's juice? [Watch this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) and 
[read this article](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130848/how_to_prototype_a_game_in_under_7_.php?print=1) to learn
about this essential game design ingredient.)

If you can make a simple game like Treasure Hunter, you can make
almost any other kind of game. Yes, really! Getting from Treasure Hunter to Skyrim
is just a matter of lots of small steps; adding more
detail as you go. How much detail you want to add is up to you. 

In the first stage of this tutorial you'll learn how the basic
Treasure Hunter game was made, and then we'll add some fun features like images and
character animation that will give you a complete overview of how the
Ga game engine works. 

If you're an experienced game programmer and
quick self-starter, you might find the code in Ga's `examples` folder to
be a more productive place to start learning - check it out. The fully
commented
code in the `examples` folder also details specific, and advanced uses
of features, that aren't
covered in these tutorials. When you're finished working through these
tutorials, the `examples` will take you on the next stage of your
journey.

#### Setting up the HTML container page

Before you can start programming in JavaScript, you need to set up a
minimal HTML container page. The HTML page loads `ga.js` and
`plugins.js` which are the two files you need to use all of Ga's
features. You'll write all your game code inside the last pair of
`<script>` tags before the closing `<body>` tag.

```
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Treasure hunter</title>
<body>
<!-- Import the Ga game engine files -->
<script src="../ga.js"></script>
<script src="../plugins.js"></script>
<script>

//All of your game code will go here

</script>
</body>

```
This is the [minimum amount of HTML code you need for a valid HTML5
document](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9797046/whats-a-valid-html5-document).

#### Initializing the Ga engine

The next step is to write some JavaScript code that initializes and starts the Ga game
engine, according to some parameters that you specify. This bit of
code below initializes a game with a screen size of 512 by 512 pixels.
It also pre-loads the `chimes.wav` sound file from the `sounds`
folder.

```
var g = ga(
  512, 512, setup,
  [
    "sounds/chimes.wav"
  ]
);

//Start the Ga engine.
g.start();

```

You can see that the result of the `ga` function is being assigned to
an object called `g`. 

    var g = ga(

Now, whenever you want to use any of Ga's custom
methods of objects in your game, just prefix it with `g`. (You don't
have to use `g` to represent the game engine, you can use any variable
name you want. `g` is just nice, short, and easy to remember; `g` =
"game".)

In this example Ga creates a canvas element with a size of 512 by 512
pixels. That's specified by the first two arguments.
  
    512, 512, setup,

The third argument, `setup`, means that as soon as Ga is initialized,
it should look for and run a function in your game code called `setup`.
Whatever code is in the `setup` function is entirely up to you, and
you'll soon see how you can used it to initialize a game. (You don't
have to call this function `setup`, you can use any name you like.) 

Ga lets you pre-load game assets with an optional 4th argument, which
is an array of file names. In this first example, you only need to preload one file: `chimes.wav`
You can see that the full file path to `chimes.wav` is listed as a
string in the
initialization array:

```
[
  "sounds/chimes.wav"
]

```

You can list as many game assets as you like here, including images,
fonts, and JSON files. Ga will load all these assets for you before
running any of the game code.

The last thing you need to do is call Ga's `start` method. 

    g.start();

This is the switch that turns the Ga engine on.

#### Define your "global" variables

After Ga has been started, declare all the variables that your game
functions will need to use.

```
var world, player, treasure, enemies, chimes, exit, player,
    healthBar, message, gameScene, gameOverScene, enemies;
```

Because they're not enclosed inside a function, these variables are "global" 
in the sense that you can use them across all of your game functions.
(They're not necessarily "global" in the sense that they inhabit the
global JavaScript name-space. If you want to ensure that they aren't, [wrap all of
your JavaScript code in an enclosing **immediate function** to isolate it
from the global
space](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17058606/why-using-self-executing-function-in-javascript).

#### Intitialize your game with a setup function

As soon as Ga starts, it will look for and run a function in your game
code called `setup` (or whatever other name you want to give this
function.) The `setup` function is only run once, and lets you perform
one-time setup tasks for your game. It's a great place to create and initialize
objects, create sprites, game scenes, populate data arrays or parse
loaded JSON game data. 

Here's an abridged, birds-eye view of the `setup` function in Treasure Hunter,
and the tasks that it performs

```
function setup() {
  //Set the canvas border and background color
  //Create the `chimes` sound object
  //Create the `gameScene` group
  //Create the `exit` door sprite
  //Create the `player` sprite
  //Create the `treasure` sprite
  //Make the enemies
  //Create the health bar
  //Add some text for the game over message
  //Create a `gameOverScene` group 
  //Assign the player's keyboard controllers

  //set the game state to `play`
  g.state = play;
}

```
The last line of code, `g.state = play` is perhaps the most important
because it starts the `play` function. The `play` function runs all the game logic
in a loop. But before we look at how that works, let's see what the
specific code inside the `setup` function does.

##### Customizing the canvas

The first two lines in the `setup` function give the canvas a black dashed border and set its
background color to white.
```
g.canvas.style.border = "1px black dashed";
g.backgroundColor = "white";
```
Here's the effect these two lines have on the Ga canvas:

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/02.png)

Ga uses an ordinary 2D canvas element to display the game graphics,
and you can access it in your code at any time with `g.canvas`. You
can modify it with any ordinary HTML/CSS properties.

##### Creating the `chimes` sound object

You'll remember from the code above that we preloaded a sound file
into the game called `chimes.wav`. Before you can use it in your game,
you have to make a reference to it using Ga's `sound` method,
like this:

    chimes = g.sound("sounds/chimes.wav");

Alternatively, you can access any assets that you've loaded via Ga's
`assets` object, like this:

    g.assets["sounds/chimes.wav"]

Any assets that you've preloaded like this are accessible in the
`assets` object.

Many assets that you might want to use, like sounds, fonts, and JSON
files, can
only be loaded by the browser if your code is running inside a
web server. If you're trying to load or use an asset, and the browser if
giving your a
strange security related error message, check to make sure that the
web server is initialized.

##### Creating game scenes

Ga has a useful method called `group` that lets you group game sprites
together so that you can work with them as one unit. This is great
for making compound sprites, and also for making game scenes. Treasure
  Hunter uses two game scenes: `gameScene` which is the main game, and
  `gameOverScene` which is displayed when the game is finished. Here's
  how the `gameScene` is made using the `group` method:

    gameScene = g.group();

Now if you want to add sprites to the `gameScene`, you can do it using
the `addChild` method.
    
    gameScene.addChild(anySprite);

Or, you can add multiple sprites at one time with the `add` method, like this:

    gameScene.add(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);

Or, if you prefer, you can create the game scene after you've made all
the sprites, and group them together with one line of code, like this:

    gameScene = g.group(spriteOne, spriteTwp, spriteThree);

You'll see a few different examples of how to add sprites to groups in
the examples ahead.

##### Making sprites

The most important elements in any game are sprites. Ga lets you make
5 kinds of basic sprites: `rectangle`, `circle`, `line`, `text`, and
`sprite` (an image-based sprite). You can make almost any 2D action game
with these basic sprite types. (If they aren't enough, you can also define your own custom
sprite types.) This first version of Treasure Hunter
only uses `rectangle` sprites. You can make a rectangle sprite like
this:

    var box = g.rectangle(
      width, height, "fillColor", "strokeColor", lineWidth, xPosition, yPosition
    );

It's often useful to prototype a new game using only `rectangle` and
`circle` sprites, because that can help you focus on the mechanics of your
game in a pure, elemental way. That's what this first version of
Treasure Hunter does. Here's the code from the `setup` function that
creates the `exit`, `player` and `treasure` sprites.

```
//The exit door
exit = g.rectangle(48, 48, "green");
exit.x = 8;
exit.y = 8;
gameScene.addChild(exit);

//The player sprite
player = g.rectangle(32, 32, "blue");
player.x = 68;
player.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfHeight;
gameScene.addChild(player);

//Create the treasure sprite
treasure = g.rectangle(16, 16, "gold");

//Position the treasure next to the left edge of the canvas
treasure.x = g.canvas.width - treasure.width - 10;
treasure.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - treasure.halfHeight;

//Create a `pickedUp` property on the treasure to help us Figure
//out whether or not the treasure has been picked up by the player
treasure.pickedUp = false;

//Add the treasure to the gameScene
gameScene.addChild(treasure);

``` 
Notice that after each sprite is created, it's added to the
`gameScene` using `addChild`. Here's what the above code produces:

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/03.png)

All sprites have `x` and `y` properties that you can use to precisely
position sprites on the canvas. They also have `width` and `height`
properties that tell you their width and height in pixels. If you need
to find out what half the width or half the height of a sprite is, use
`halfWidth` and `halfHeight`.

This code also adds a `pickedUp` property to the `treasure` sprite
that we'll use later in the game logic to help us determine the
progress of the game.

    treasure.pickedUp = false;

You can dynamically assign any custom properties or methods to sprites
as you like.

##### Creating the enemy sprites

There are 6 enemies sprites (red squares) in Treasure Hunter. They're
spaced evenly horizontally but but have random initial vertical
positions. All the enemies sprites are created in a `for`  loop using
this code in the `setup` function:

```
//Make the enemies
var numberOfEnemies = 6,
    spacing = 48,
    xOffset = 150,
    speed = 2,
    direction = 1;

enemies = [];

//Make as many enemies as there are `numberOfEnemies`
for (var i = 0; i < numberOfEnemies; i++) {

  //Each enemy is a red rectangle
  var enemy = g.rectangle(32, 32, "red");

  //Space each enemey horizontally according to the `spacing` value.
  //`xOffset` determines the point from the left of the screen
  //at which the first enemy should be added.
  var x = spacing * i + xOffset;

  //Give the enemy a random y position
  var y = g.random(0, g.canvas.height - enemy.height);

  //Set the enemy's direction
  enemy.x = x;
  enemy.y = y;

  //Set the enemy's vertical velocity. `direction` will be either `1` or
  //`-1`. `1` means the enemy will move down and `-1` means the enemy will
  //move up. Multiplying `direction` by `speed` determines the enemy's
  //vertical direction
  enemy.vy = speed * direction;

  //Reverse the direction for the next enemy
  direction *= -1;

  //Push the enemy into the `enemies` array
  enemies.push(enemy);

  //Add the enemy to the `gameScene`
  gameScene.addChild(enemy);
}

```
Here's what this code produces:

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/04.png)

The code gives each of the enemies a random `y` position with the help
of Ga's `random` method:
```
var y = g.random(0, g.canvas.height - enemy.height);
```
`random` will give you a random number between any two integers that you
provide in the arguments. (If you need a random decimal number, use
`randomFloat` instead).

All sprites have properties called `vx` and `vy`. They determine the
speed and direction that the sprite will move in the horizontal
direction (`vx`) and vertical direction (`vy`).  The enemies in
Treasure Hunter only move up and down, so they just need a `vy` value.
Their `vy` is `speed` (2) multiplied by `direction` (which will be
either `1` or `-1`).

    enemy.vy = speed * direction;

If `direction` is `1`, the enemy's `vy` will be `2`. That means the
enemy will move down the screen at a rate of 2 pixels per frame. If
`direction` is `-1`, the enemy's speed will be `-2`. That means the
enemy will move up the screen at 2 pixels per frame. 

After the enemy's `vy` is set, `direction` is reversed so that the next
enemy will move in the opposite direction.

    direction *= -1;

You can see that each enemy that's created is pushed into an array
called `enemies`.

    enemies.push(enemy);

Later in the code you'll see how we'll access all the enemies in this
array to figure out if they're touching the player.

##### The health bar

You'll notice that when the player
touches one of the enemies, the width of the health bar at the top right corner of
the screen decreases. 

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/05.png)

How was this health bar made? It's just two rectangle sprites at the same
position: a black rectangle behind, and a green rectangle in front. They're grouped
together to make a single compound sprite called `healthBar`. The
`healthBar` is then added to the `gameScene`.

```
//Create the health bar
var outerBar = g.rectangle(128, 16, "black"),
    innerBar = g.rectangle(128, 16, "yellowGreen");

//Group the inner and outer bars
healthBar = g.group(outerBar, innerBar);

//Set the `innerBar` as a property of the `healthBar`
healthBar.inner = innerBar;

//Position the health bar
healthBar.x = g.canvas.width - 148;
healthBar.y = 16;

//Add the health bar to the `gameScene`
gameScene.addChild(healthBar);
```
You can see that a property called `inner` has been added to the
`healthBar`. It just references the `innerBar` (the green rectangle) so that
it will be convenient to access later.

    healthBar.inner = innerBar;

You don't *have* to do this; but, hey why not! It means that if you
want to control the width of the `innerBar`, you can write some smooth code
that looks like this:

    healthBar.inner.width = 30;

That's pretty neat and readable, so we'll keep it!

##### The game over scene

If the player's health drops to zero, or the player manages to
carry the treasure to the exit, the game ends and the game over screen
is displayed.  The game over scene is just some text that displays "You won!" or "You
lost!" depending on the outcome. 

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/06.png)

How was this made? The text is made with a `text` sprite. 

```
var anyText = g.text(
  "Hello!", "CSS font properties", "fillColor", xPosition, yPosition
);

```
The first argument, "Hello!" in the above example, is the text content
you want to display. Use the `content` property to change the text
sprite's content later.

    anyText.content = "Some new content";

Here's how the game over message text is created in the `setup`
function. 

```
//Add some text for the game over message
message = g.text("Game Over!", "64px Futura", "black", 20, 20);
message.x = 120;
message.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - 64;
```
Next, a new `group` is created called `gameOverScene`. The `message` text
is added to it. The `gameOverScene`'s `visible` property is set to
`false` so that it's not visible when the game first starts.

```
//Create a `gameOverScene` group and add the message sprite to it
gameOverScene = g.group(message);

//Make the `gameOverScene` invisible for now
gameOverScene.visible = false;

```
At the end of the game we'll set the `gameOverScene`'s `visible`
property to `true` to display the text message. We'll also set the
`gameScene`'s `visible` property to `false` so that all the game
sprites are hidden.

##### Keyboard interactivity

You control the player (the blue square) with the keyboard arrow keys.
Ga has a built-in `key` object with keyboard bindings 
to the arrow keys and space bar. Access them like this:
`key.leftArray`, `key.rightArrow`, `key.upArrow`, `key.downArrow`,
`key.space`. All these keys have `press` and
`release` methods that you can define.  Here's code in the `setup`
function that customizes the `press` and `release` methods of   
Ga's pre-defined arrow keys to control the player character: 
```
//Left arrow key `press` method
g.key.leftArrow.press = function() {
  //Change the player's velocity when the key is pressed
  player.vx = -5;
  player.vy = 0;
};
//Left arrow key `release` method
g.key.leftArrow.release = function() {
  //If the left arrow has been released, and the right arrow isn't down,
  //and the player isn't moving vertically:
  //Stop the player
  if (!g.key.rightArrow.isDown && player.vy === 0) {
    player.vx = 0;
  }
};
g.key.upArrow.press = function() {
  player.vy = -5;
  player.vx = 0;
};
g.key.upArrow.release = function() {
  if (!g.key.downArrow.isDown && player.vx === 0) {
    player.vy = 0;
  }
};
g.key.rightArrow.press = function() {
  player.vx = 5;
  player.vy = 0;
};
g.key.rightArrow.release = function() {
  if (!g.key.leftArrow.isDown && player.vy === 0) {
    player.vx = 0;
  }
};
g.key.downArrow.press = function() {
  player.vy = 5;
  player.vx = 0;
};
g.key.downArrow.release = function() {
  if (!g.key.upArrow.isDown && player.vx === 0) {
    player.vy = 0;
  }
};

```
You can see that the value of the player's `vx` and `vy` properties is
changed depending on which keys are being pressed or released.
A positive `vx` value will make the player move right, a negative
value will make it move left. A positive `vy` value will make the
player move
down, a negative value will make it move up. 

Is that too much typing? Because controlling a player character with 4
keyboard keys is such a common requirement, Ga has a built-in function called
`fourKeyController` that accomplishes all this in one line of code.

    g.fourKeyController(player, 5, 38, 39, 40, 37);

The first argument is the sprite you want to control: `player`. The
second argument is the number of pixels that the sprite should move each frame: `5`.
The last four arguments are the [ascii key code numbers](http://www.asciitable.com) for the top,
right, bottom and left keys. (You can remember this because their
order is listed clockwise, starting from the top.)

Reference to the arrow keys and space key are built-in to Ga, but you
if want to use other keys, you can easily create and assign your own
with Ga's `keybaord` method:

    var customKey = g.keyboard(asciiCode);

Your new `customKey` has `press` and `release` methods
that you can program in the same way as the examples above. 

##### Setting the game state

The **game state** is the function that Ga is currently running. When
Ga first starts, it runs the `setup` function (or whatever other
function you specify in Ga's constructor function arguments.) If you
want to change the game state, assign a new function to Ga's `state`
property. Here's how:

    g.state = anyFunction;

In Treasure Hunter, when the `setup` function is finished, the game
`state` is set to `play`:

    g.state = play;

This makes Ga look for and run a function called `play`. By default,
any function assigned to the game state will run in a continuous loop, at
60 frames per second. (You can change the frame rate at any time by setting Ga's
`fps` property). Game logic usually runs in a continuous loop, which
is known as the **game loop**. Ga handles the loop management for you,
so you don't need to worry about how it works. (In case you're curious, Ga uses
a `requestAnimationFrame` loop with a [fixed logic time step and variable rendering time](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html). It
also does sprite position interpolation to smooth out any inconsistent
spikes in the frame rate.)

If you ever need to pause the loop, just use Ga's `pause`method, like
this:

    g.pause();

You can start the game loop again with the `resume` method, like this:

    g.resume();

Now let's find out how Treasure Hunter's `play` function works. 

#### Game logic with the play function loop

As you've just learned, everything in the `play` function runs in a
continuous loop.

```
function play() {
  //This code loops from top to bottom 60 times per second  
}
```
This is where all the game logic happens. It's the fun part,
so let's find out what the code inside the `play` function does.

##### Moving the player sprite

Treasure Hunter uses Ga's `move` method inside the `play` function to move the sprites in the
game.

    g.move(player);

This is the equivalent of writing code like this:

```
player.x += player.vx;
player.y += player.vy;
```
It just updates the player's `x` and `y` position by adding its `vx`
and `vy` velocity values. (Remember, those values were
set by the key `press` and `release` methods.) Using `move` just saves
you from having to type-in and look-at this very standard boilerplate
code.

You can also move a whole array of sprites with one line of code by
supplying the array as the argument.

    g.move(arrayOfSprites);

So now you can easily move the player, but what happens when the
player reaches the edges of the screen?

##### Containing sprites inside the screen boundaries

Use Ga's `contain` method to keep sprites inside the boundaries of
the screen.

    g.contain(player, g.stage.localBounds);

The first argument is the sprite you want to contain, and the second
argument is any JavaScript object with an `x`, `y`, `width`, and
`height` property. As a convenience, all Ga sprites have a property
called `localBounds` that return an object with this information.

`stage` is the root container object for all Ga's sprites, and it has
the same width and height as the `canvas`. That means you can use its
`localBounds` property to keep the sprite contained inside the canvas.

But you can alternatively supply a custom object to do the same thing. Here's how:

```
g.contain(
  player, 
  {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    width: 512,
    height: 512
  }
);
```
This will contain the `player` sprite to an area defined by the
dimensions of the object. This is really convenient if you want to
precisely fine-tune the area in which the object should be contained.

`contain` has an extra useful feature. If the sprite reaches one of
the containment edges, `contain` will return a string that tells you
which edge it reached: "top", "right", "bottom", or "left". Here's how
you could use this feature to find out which edge of the canvas the
sprite is touching:

```
var playerHitsEdges = g.contain(player, g.stage.localBounds);

//Display the edge of canvas that the player hit
if (playerHitsEdges) {
  message.content 
    = "The player hit the " + playerHitsEdges + " of the canvas";
}
```
##### Collision with the enemies

When the player hits any of the enemies, the width of the health bar
decreases and the player becomes semi-transparent.

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/07.png)

How does this work?

Ga has a full suite of useful 2D geometric and tile-based collision
detection methods. You can read all about them in Ga's `examples`
folder. Treasure Hunter only uses one of these collision methods:
`hitTestRectangle`. It takes two rectangular sprites and tells you
whether they're overlapping. It will return `true` if they are, and
`false` if they aren't.

     g.hitTestRectangle(spriteOne, spriteTwo);

Here's how the code in the `play` function uses `hitTestRectangle` to
check for a collision between any of the enemies and the player.
```
//Set `playerHit` to `false` before checking for a collision
var playerHit = false;

//Loop through all the sprites in the `enemies` array
enemies.forEach(function(enemy) {

  //Move the enemy
  g.move(enemy);

  //Check the enemy's screen boundaries
  var enemyHitsEdges = g.contain(enemy, g.stage.localBounds);

  //If the enemy hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse
  //its direction
  if (enemyHitsEdges === "top" || enemyHitsEdges === "bottom") {
    enemy.vy *= -1;
  }

  //Test for a collision. If any of the enemies are touching
  //the player, set `playerHit` to `true`
  if(g.hitTestRectangle(player, enemy)) {
    playerHit = true;
  }
});

//If the player is hit...
if(playerHit) {
  //Make the player semi-transparent
  player.alpha = 0.5;
  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel
  healthBar.inner.width -= 1;
} else {
  //Make the player fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit
  player.alpha = 1;
}
```
This bit of code creates a variable called `playerHit`, which is
initialized to `false` just before the `forEach` loop checks all the
enemies for a collision.

    var playerHit = false;

(Because the `play` function is run 60 times per second, `playerHit`
will be reinitialized to `false` on every new frame.)

If `hitTestRectangle` returns `true`, the `forEach` loop sets
`playerHit` to `true`.

```
if(g.hitTestRectangle(player, enemy)) {
  playerHit = true;
}
```

If the player has been hit, the code makes the player semi-transparent by
setting its `alpha` value to 0.5. It also reduces the width of the
`healthBar`'s `inner` sprite by 1 pixel.

```
if(playerHit) {
  //Make the player semi-transparent
  player.alpha = 0.5;
  //Reduce the width of the health bar's inner rectangle by 1 pixel
  healthBar.inner.width -= 1;
} else {
  //Make the player fully opaque (non-transparent) if it hasn't been hit
  player.alpha = 1;
}
```
You can set the `alpha` property of sprites to any value between `0`
(fully transparent) to `1` (fully opaque). A value of `0.5` makes it
semi-transparent.b (**Alpha** is a
well-worn graphic design term that just means **transparency**.)

This bit of code also uses the `move` method to move the enemies, and
`contain` to keep them contained inside the canvas. The code also uses
the return value of `contain` to find out if the enemy is hitting the
top or bottom of the canvas. If it hits the top or bottom, the enemy's direction is
reversed with the help of this code:

```
//Check the enemy's screen boundaries
var enemyHitsEdges = g.contain(enemy, g.stage.localBounds);

//If the enemy hits the top or bottom of the stage, reverse
//its direction
if (enemyHitsEdges === "top" || enemyHitsEdges === "bottom") {
  enemy.vy *= -1;
}
```

Multiplying the enemy's `vy` (vertical velocity) value by negative 1
makes it go in the opposite direction. It's a really simple **bounce**
effect.

###### Collision with the treasure

If the player touches the treasure (the yellow square), the `chimes`
sound plays. The player can then
carry the treasure to the exit. The treasure is centered over the player and
moves along with it. 

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/08.png)

Here's the code from the `play` function that achieves these effects.

```
//Check for a collision between the player and the treasure
if (g.hitTestRectangle(player, treasure)) {

  //If the treasure is touching the player, center it over the player
  treasure.x = player.x + 8;
  treasure.y = player.y + 8;

  if(!treasure.pickedUp) {
    //If the treasure hasn't already been picked up,
    //play the `chimes` sound
    chimes.play();
    treasure.pickedUp = true;
  };
}
```
You can see that the code uses `hitTestRectangle` inside an `if`
statement to test for a collision between the player and the treasure.

    if (g.hitTestRectangle(player, treasure)) {

If it's `true`, the treasure is centered over the player.

```
treasure.x = player.x + 8;
treasure.y = player.y + 8;
```

If `treasure.pickedUp` is `false`, then you know that the treasure hasn't already been 
picked up, and you can play the `chimes` sound:

    chimes.play();

In addition to `play` Ga's sound objects also have a few more methods that you can use to control them:
`pause`, `restart` and `playFrom`. (Use `playFrom` to start playing
the sound from a specific second in the sound file, like this:
`soundObject.playFrom(5)`. This will make the sound start playing from
the 5 second mark.)

You can also set the sound object's `volume` by assigning
a value between 0 and 1. Here's how to set the `volume` to mid-level
(50%).

    soundObject.volume = 0.5;

You can set the sound object's `pan` by assigning a value between -1 (left speaker)
to 1 (right speaker). A pan value of 0 makes the sound equal volume in
both speakers. Here's how you could set the `pan` to be slightly more
prominent in the left speaker.

    soundObject.pan = -0.2;

If you want to make a sound repeat continuously, set its `loop` property to `true`.

    soundObject.loop = true;

Ga uses a [lightweight wrapper for the WebAudio
API](https://gist.github.com/kittykatattack/cd41b480e94fd32d8ad5) to achieve all these
effects.

Because you don't want to play the `chimes` sound more than once after
the treasure has been picked up, the code sets `treasure.pickedUp` to
`true` just after the sound plays.

    treasure.pickedUp = true;

Now that the player has picked up the treasure, how can you check for
the end of the game?

##### Ending the game

There are two ways the game can end. The player's health can run out,
in which case the game is lost. Or, the player can successfully carry
the treasure to the exit, in which case the game is won. If either of
these two conditions are met,  the game's `state` is set to `end` and
the `message` text's `content` displays the outcome. Here's the last
bit of code in the `play` function that does this:
```
//Does the player have enough health? If the width of the `innerBar`
//is less than zero, end the game and display "You lost!"
if (healthBar.inner.width < 0) {
  g.state = end;
  message.content = "You lost!";
}

//If the player has brought the treasure to the exit,
//end the game and display "You won!"
if (g.hitTestRectangle(treasure, exit)) {
  g.state = end;
  message.content = "You won!";
}

```
The `end` function is really simple. It just hides the `gameScene` and
displays the `gameOverScene`.
```
function end() {
  gameScene.visible = false;
  gameOverScene.visible = true;
}

```
And that's it for Treasure Hunter! Before you continue, try making
your own game from scratch using some of these same techniques. When
you're ready, read on!

### Using images

There are three main ways you can use images in your Ga games. 

- Use individual image files for each sprite.
- Use a **texture atlas**. This is a single image file that includes
  sub-images for each sprite in your game. The image file is
  accompanied by a matching JSON
  data file that describes the name, size and location of each
  sub-image.
- Use a **tileset** (also known as a **spritesheet**). This is also a single
  image file that includes sub-images for each sprite. However, unlike a
  texture atlas, it doesn't come with a JSON file describing the
  sprite data. Instead, you need to specify the size and location of
  each sprite in your game code with JavaScript. This can have some
  advantages over a texture atlas in certain circumstances.

All three ways of making image sprites use Ga's `sprite` method.
Here's the simplest way of using it to make an image sprite.

    var imageSprite = g.sprite("images/theSpriteImage.png");

In
this next section we'll update Treasure Hunter with image sprites, and
you'll learn all three ways of adding images to your games.

(All the images in this section were created by Lanea Zimmerman. You
can find more of her artwork
[here](http://opengameart.org/users/sharm).
Thanks, Lanea!)

#### Individual images

Open and play the next version of Treasure Hunter:
`02_treasureHunterImages.html` (you'll find in the `tutorials`
folder.) It plays exactly the same as the first version, but all the
colored squares have been replaced by images.

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/09.png)

Take a look at the source code, and you'll notice that the game logic
and structure is exactly the same as the first version of the game.
The only thing that's changed is the appearance of the sprites.
How was this done?

##### Loading image files 

Each sprite in the game uses an individual PNG image file. You'll find
all the images in the tutorials' `images` sub-folder.

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/10.png)

Before you can use them to make sprites, you need to pre-load them into
Ga's `assets`. The easiest way to do this is to list the image names,
with their full file paths, in Ga's assets array when you first
initialize the engine.
```
var g = ga(
  512, 512, setup,
  [
    "images/explorer.png",
    "images/dungeon.png",
    "images/blob.png",
    "images/treasure.png",
    "images/door.png",
    "sounds/chimes.wav"
  ]
);
g.start();
```
(If you open up the JavaScript console in the web browser, you can
monitor the loading progress of these assets.)

Now you can access any of these images in your game code like this:

    g.image("images/blob.png")

This is just a short-cut for accessing the image directly in the
`assets` object like this:

    g.assets["images/blob.png"]

You can use whichever style you prefer. In any case, the image file
is just an ordinary JavaScript `Image` object, so you can use
it the same way you would any other `Image` object. 

Although pre-loading the images and other assets is the simplest way
to get them into your game, you can also load assets at any other time
using the `assets` object's `load` method. Just supply an array of strings
that list the asset names and their file paths.
```
g.assets.load([
  "images/imageOne.png", 
  "images/imageTwo.png",
  "sounds/chimes.wav"
]);
```
Next, assign a callback function called `whenLoaded` that will run when the assets have
loaded. 
```
g.assets.whenLoaded = function() {
  //Do something when the assets have loaded
};
```
Now that you've loaded the images into the game, let's find out how to
use them to make sprites.

##### Making sprites with images

Create an image sprite using the `sprite` method, in format you learnt
above. Here's how to create a sprite using the `dungeon.png` image.
(`dungeon.png` is a 512 by 512 pixel background image.)

    dungeon = g.sprite("images/dungeon.png");

That's all! Now instead of displaying as a simple colored rectangle,
the sprite will be displayed as a 512 by 512 image. There's no need
to specify the width or height, because Ga figures that our for you
automatically based on the size of the image. You can use all the other
sprite properties, like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`, just as you
would with ordinary rectangle sprites. 

Here's the code from the `setup` function that creates the dungeon
background, exit door, player and treasure, and adds them all to the
`gameScene` group. 
```
//The dungeon background
dungeon = g.sprite("images/dungeon.png");

//The exit door
exit = g.sprite("images/door.png");
exit.x = 32;

//The player sprite
player = g.sprite("images/explorer.png");
player.x = 68;
player.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - player.halfWidth;

//Create the treasure
treasure = g.sprite("images/treasure.png");

//Position it next to the left edge of the canvas
treasure.x = g.canvas.width - treasure.width - 32;
treasure.y = g.canvas.height / 2 - treasure.halfHeight;

//Create a `pickedUp` property on the treasure to help us Figure
//out whether or not the treasure has been picked up by the player
treasure.pickedUp = false;

//Create the `gameScene` group and add all the sprites
gameScene = g.group(dungeon, exit, player, treasure);
```
(As a slightly more efficient improvement to the
original version of this code, `group` creates the `gameScene` and groups
the sprites in a single step.)

Look familiar? That's right, the only code that has changed are the
lines that create the sprites. This modularity is a feature of Ga that lets you create quick
game prototypes using simple shapes that you can easily swap out for
detailed images as your game idea develops. The rest of the code in the
game can remain as-is.

##### Fine-tuning the containment area

One small improvement that was made to this new version Treasure
Hunter is the new way that the sprites are contained inside the walls of the
dungeon. They're contained in such a way that naturally matches the 2.5D perspective of the
artwork, as shown by the green square in this screen shot:

![Treasure Hunter](/tutorials/screenshots/11.png)

This is a very easy modification to make. All you need to do is supply
the `contain` method with a custom object that defines the size and
position of the containing rectangle. Here's how:
```
g.contain(
  player,
  {
    x: 32, y: 16,
    width: g.canvas.width - 32,
    height: g.canvas.height - 32
  }
);
```
Just tweak the `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` values so that the
containing area looks natural for the game you're making.

#### Using a texture atlas

... Coming soon! (But if you're in a hurry, check the examples of how
to use a texture atlas in the `examples` folder.)
